Damage formula:

rand_modifier = random value between 0.8-1.2 
	(val < 0.85 print: "Grazing Hit.". val > 1.15 print: "Critical hit!")
wdmg = weapon damage
ap = armor piercing
(armor - ap) can't go below 0

dmg = rand_modifier * round(attack / defence * wdmg - (armor - ap))

Hit Point formula:

follows a recursive pattern. hp_0 is the starting value.

hp_0 = 10
hp = hp_prev + vit

1 vit  = 10 hp
2 vit  = 11 hp
3 vit  = 13 hp
4 vit  = 16 hp
5 vit  = 20 hp
6 vit  = 25 hp //average level 1 value
7 vit  = 31 hp
8 vit  = 38 hp
9 vit  = 46 hp
10 vit = 55 hp
11 vit = 65 hp
12 vit = 76 hp
